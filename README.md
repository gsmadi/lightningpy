# pylnd

Python client for Lightning Network Deamon [(LND)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) with batteries included.

Planned support for both REST and gRPC.

Only supporting Python 3 since we should not be using Python 2.x anymore.

## Getting started

### Development

Make a virtual environment,

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install,

`python setup.py develop`
